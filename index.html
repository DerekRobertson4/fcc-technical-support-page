                Using the Super Awesome Program is easy. Just come up with an idea, translate it to the machine code  of your choice (to the best you can),
                and have fun! Our interpreter will correct almost all syntax errors and alert you when it is unsure of what command 
                you are trying to perform. Software developing has never been this easy.
